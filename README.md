# Mimosa
Quinton's Ray Tracer with Metal

## Introduction
This is an exercise project for writing ray tracing in Metal shader. The project is based on sample code [Accelerating ray tracing using Metal](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/accelerating_ray_tracing_using_metal) from Apple. The sample code is written in Objective-C and Metal Shading Language. Hopefully, I will add Metal-CPP support to this project in the future.

## App Viewer
The app viewer is written in Swift. It is a simple app that can load a scene and render it. You can simply choose different scenes and path tracing algorithms.

Here's a little video to help you learn how to operate the app.
